This repository is meant for the porting of SFLphone to Android.


To build SFLphone and all its dependencies, make sure that Android's NDK and SDK
are properly installed on your system. 

You have also to make sure that the following environment variables are defined:

export ANDROID_NDK=$HOME/path/to/android-ndk-r*b
export ANDROID_SDK=$HOME/path/to/android-sdk-linux

The path to the required Android's build executable must be also specified:

export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_NDK
